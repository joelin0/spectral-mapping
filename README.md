Spectral Tools for Mapping Logical Qubits of Circuits onto Connectivity-Constrained Physical Architectures

## Requirements
This code has been tested using Python 3.6.5 on MacOS.

The code makes use of `networkx`, `numpy`, `scipy`, and `matplotlib`. Quick installation of these packages can be performed by running

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

## Usage
To generate an equivalent SWAP-compliant circuit for a given example circuit, run the command
```
python3 main.py <filename> <benchmark_folder> <result_folder>
```
For example, if you have a benchmark in `benchmarks/example.qasm` and wish to output the results into a folder `results`, run
```
python3 main.py example.qasm benchmarks results
```

Note that the input file is to be given in OpenQASM format and should only contain single- or two-qubit gates. 

The connectivity compliant circuits generated this algorithm are written to the `<result_folder>` provided. 

We have also provided a script that allows for many benchmarks to be run, and for the resulting swap count and timing to be output in a summary file. This command can be run as
```
sh run_all_files.sh <benchmark_list> <benchmark_folder> <compliant_circuit_output_folder> <summary_file>
```
For example, using our given example benchmarks in `examples` and a list of benchamrks to run, as in `filenames.txt`, running
```
sh run_all_files.sh filenames.txt examples compliant_circuits summary.txt
```
will run our algorithm on the list of benchmarks, give the set of compliant circuits generated for each benchmark in `compliant_circuits`, and summarize the time and best swap count for each benchmark.

## Data Analysis
We have also added some data analysis scripts that we used in our paper to compare several algorithms. This requires having previously run other algorithms and summarizing them into files with the same format as those produced by `run_all_files.sh`. The summary files used in the paper can be found in the `results/summary` folder. 

Note that to run the table generation, the `tabulate` python package must be installed, e.g. via `pip install tabulate`.
